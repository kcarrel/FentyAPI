# Fenty Beauty API


**Authors**: [Katie Carrel](https://kcarrel.github.io/)

## Overview
An example to illustrate the argument that beauty brands should be participating in the API economy. This is an open-source API which provides product information from Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. This information is publicly sourced from [Fenty Beauty](https://www.fentybeauty.com/); I do not claim to own it.

## Technologies used
Ruby on Rails

## Routes
**All routes are GET routes**

* **GET /products** - get all products
* **GET /products/${ProductId}** - get product by id
* **GET /name/${ProductName}** - get product by name
* **GET /collection/${ProductCollection}** - get product by collection
* **GET /random** - get a random product
